# closestpoint
The points are spread throughout the 2D or 3D plane. When a new point is  inserted  have  to  find  the  closest  set  of  point or points.

The input format be as follows:

First line the number of points(N) in the scenariofollowed by the threshold T. N and T are space separated.
Eg: 75 2

Line 2 to N+1, will contain the coordinates of the points separated by lines
Eg:  
(2, 5)
(4, 6)

Your program should be able to take pointsas input during runtime to test the closest set.
